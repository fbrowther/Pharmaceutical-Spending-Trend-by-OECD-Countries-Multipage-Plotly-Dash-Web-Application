The aim of our project is to use the ETL process to clean a dataset relating to our chosen topic 
of uncovering gender patterns in video games across multiple platforms focusing on gender
representation within modern day video games. 

### Data Sources

We found and used three datasets that focused on gender representation within modern day video games, sourced from Kaggle.com & diamondlobby.com. These datasets were games data, character data & sexualisation info.

we had a realistic timeline to complete the project as well as safeguard by having regular reviews.  

o    Project ideation  
o    Data fetching  
o    Data analysis  
o    Cleaning & Transforming  
o    Data loading into final database  
o    Creating documentation (Technical report and Project Visuals)
